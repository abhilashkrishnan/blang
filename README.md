# Blaze Language and Virtual Machine

#### General Purpose Programming Language and Virtual Machine for Multi-Core Processors and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) Computing.

Blaze will be a compiled and interpreted programming language. Blaze Compiler will generate Blaze Bytecode (Intermediate Language Representation) in a Blaze Class file. Blaze VM will execute the Class file containing Bytecode at runtime. Blaze VM will be a Stack based Virtual Machine implementation written in C++ 17 standards.

An example Bytecode generated by Blaze Compiler is:

```2 42 // PUSH 42
18 0 // STORE 0
17 0 // LOAD 0
1 // HALT
```

Blaze VM will interpret and execute the Bytecode at runtime.

Blaze VM Instruction Set for the above Bytecode is:

```PUSH 42
STORE 0
LOAD 0 
HALT
```
