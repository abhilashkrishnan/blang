# Blaze Language and Virtual Machine

#### General Purpose Programming Language and Virtual Machine for Multi-Core Processors and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) Computing.

Blaze will be a compiled and interpreted programming language. Blaze Compiler will generate Blaze Bytecode (Intermediate Language Representation). Blaze VM will execute the Bytecode at runtime. Blaze VM will be a Stack based Virtual Machine implementation.

An example Bytecode generated by Blaze Compiler is:

```PUSH 42
STORE 0
LOAD 0 
HALT
```

Blaze VM will execute the Bytecode at runtime. Sample machine language generated by the Blaze Class Disassembler is:

```2 42 // PUSH 42
18 0 // STORE 0
17 0 // LOAD 0
1 // HALT
```
