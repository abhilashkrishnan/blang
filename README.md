# Blaze Language and Virtual Machine

#### General Purpose Programming Language and Virtual Machine for MultiCore Processors and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) Computing.

Blaze will be a compiled and interpreted language. Blaze compiler will generate Blaze Bytecode. Blaze VM will execute the bytecode at runtime.
Blaze VM will be a Stack based Virtual Machine implementation.

An example bytecode generated by the compiler is:

```PUSH 42
STORE 0
LOAD 0 
HALT
```

Blaze VM will execute the bytecode at runtime. Sample machine language executed by the Blaze VM is:

```2 42 // PUSH 42
18 0 // STORE 0
17 0 // LOAD 0
1 // HALT
```
